# Stopping-sets-enumerator
Linear Programming based stopping set counter for QC-LDPC codes. Take QC code specification from testInput.txt, 
based on E. Rosnes and O. Ytrehus, "An Efficient Algorithm to Find All Small-Size Stopping Sets of Low-Density Parity-Check Matrices," in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 55, no. 9, pp. 4167-4178, Sept. 2009.
use CLP/CoinUtil 1.16.11 library (could be easy implemented by proprietar CPLeX and Gurobi, with several time speed-up).
